This code is supplementary to the publication "Controlling pericellular oxygen tension in cell culture reveals distinct breast cancer responses to low oxygen tensions" published in Advanced Science in 2024 (https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202402557). There are 3 files of MATLAB code: (1) analytical diffusion model, (2) numerical diffusion model, and (3) reaction diffusion model. Users can input cell culture parameters into the reaction diffusion model to predict pericellular oxygen kinetics. An Excel file with cell culture vessel geometries is also provided.
